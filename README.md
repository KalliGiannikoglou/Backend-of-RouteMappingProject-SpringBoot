# Backend of the RouteMappingProject in Spring Boot
This is the Backend of a Route Mapping Service. The Algorithmic part is developped in Java, the Backend is in Spring Boot and the Frontend in React.
The integrated algorithmic part is publicly available in this [repository](https://github.com/KalliGiannikoglou/RouteMappingProject).
The Frontend of the Application, built in React, is publicly available in this [repository](https://github.com/KalliGiannikoglou/Frontend-of-Route-Mapping-Project-React)
The building is done using Maven.

## Useful Instructions
To initialize the project, we used Spring Initializr, download [here](https://start.spring.io/). 
From there all the necessary configurations are done automatically and the basic Java Classes are created.
Having completed this process, the appropriate Components need to be added in the `src` directory and then by pressing _play_ button, the server is set up and the application is executed.
